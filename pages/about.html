    <p class="w3-justify">
      Captain Tyler has been a fishing fanatic since he was old enough to hold a rod. At age 8 his father 
      and grandfather introduced him to the fly rod. The rest is history. Throughout college in Ohio, 
      Captain Tyler guided for anything with fins. He has since graduated to being a full time professional 
      fishing guide, spending over 300 days a year on the water.
      <br><br>
      From October to May, Captain Tyler can be found putting clients on Tarpon, Snook, Redfish and Speckled 
      Trout in the Indian River Lagoon and surrounding waters. The Captain's summer months are spent in 
      Yellowstone country, guiding the most famous trout streams in the mountain west; the Yellowstone, the 
      Henry's Fork, the Madison, and the South Fork of the Snake.
  ​   <br><br>
      An expert fly tyer and fly cast instructor, Captain Tyler is a consummate professional in the fly fishing 
      world, but he also knows what it takes to catch fish. If light artificial lures, or even live bait is needed 
      to get the job done, Captain Tyler will do whatever necessary to ensure you have a great day on the water.
      <br><br>
